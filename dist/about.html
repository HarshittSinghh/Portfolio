            Hello There, I'm Harshit Kumar Singh, currently pursuing my B.Tech
            at KIIT Bhubaneswar University. With a passion for technology, I've
            delved into various aspects of programming and web development. I'm
            proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, having created engaging and responsive user interfaces.
            Furthermore, my programming skills extend to C, where I've tackled
            various projects and courses in Data Structures and Algorithms.
            Through collaborative projects and coursework, I've developed a
            strong problem-solving mindset and an eagerness to apply my skills
            in practical scenarios. I'm enthusiastic about joining innovative
            teams where I can contribute and grow further.
